    <p id="a2">Whats is HTML</p><br>
    <br>
    <span><span id="a3">Hypertext Markup Language</span> <span id="a4">(HTML)</span> is the stadart markup language for creating web pages and web applications</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>Web browserrs receive <span class="z1">HTML</span> documents from a web server of from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="z1">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the apperance of the documents</span><br>
    <br>
    <span><span class="z1">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="z1">HTML</span> pages. With <span class="z1">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive formsmay be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="z1">HTML</span> provides a meants to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes anr other items. <span class="z1">HTML</span> elements are delineated by <span class="z3">tags,</span> written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="z2">&lt;img/&gt;</span> and <span class="z2">&lt;input/&gt;</span> directly introduce content inte the page. Other tags such as <span class="z2">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide information about documents text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <span class="z1">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content or the page.</span>

    <br>
    <span><span class="z1">HTML</span> markup consist of several ley components, including those called <span class="z3">tags</span> (and their <span class="z3">attributes</span>), character-based <span class="z3"> types, character references</span> and <span class="z3">references</span>. <span class="z1">HTML</span> tags most comonnly come in pairs like <span class="z2">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="z2">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent <span class="z3"> empty elements</span> and so areunpaired, for example <span class="z2">&lt;img&gt;</span>. The first tag in such a pair is the <span class="z3"> start tag</span>, and the second is the <span class="z3">end tag</span>(they are also called <span class="z3">openning</span> <span class="z3">tags</span> and <span class="z3">closing tags</span>)</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Another important component is the <span class="z1">HTML</span> <span class="z3">documents type declaration,</span> which truggers standads mode rendering</span>
